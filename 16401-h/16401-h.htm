<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>Writing in the <i>Echo de Paris</i> "<font class="sc">Pertinax</font>"
  asks Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd George</font> to make some quite clear
  statement regarding his advice to electors. There is more innocence in
  Paris than you might suppose.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Professor <font class="sc">Waller</font> has demonstrated by
  experiment that emotion can be measured. At the same time he discouraged
  the man who asked for a couple of yards of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Churchill's</font> feelings when reading <i>The Morning
  Post</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Sir <font class="sc">Thomas Lipton's</font> challenge for the America
  Cup has been accepted by the New York Yacht Club. It appears that neither
  Mr. Secretary <font class="sc">Daniels</font> nor "President" <font
  class="sc">de Valera</font> was consulted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Widespread alarm has been caused in London by the report that a
  certain famous artist has threatened to paint a Futurist picture of a
  typical O.B.E.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Dutch paper reminds us that the ex-<font
  class="sc">Crown-Prince</font> has taken a Berlin University degree. We
  can only suppose that nobody saw him take it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In the case of a will recently admitted to probate it was stated that
  the testator had disposed of over seven hundred thousand pounds in less
  than a hundred words. It is not expected that the Ministry of Munitions
  will take this lying down.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is said that unless the new Unemployment Insurance is an
  improvement on the present rates quite a number of deserving people will
  be thrown into work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Much sympathy is felt for the burglars who broke into a house at Herne
  Hill last week. Unfortunately for them the grocer's bill had been paid
  the previous day.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We gather that, if <font class="sc">Dempsey</font> still refuses to
  come to London to fight <font class="sc">Carpentier</font>, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Cochran</font> will arrange to take London out to him.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Lobby Correspondent of <i>The Daily Express</i> states that it has
  been suggested that the <font class="sc">Premier</font> should take a
  long voyage round the world. It would be interesting to know whether the
  proposal comes from England or the world.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The honest man in Germany," says Herr <font class="sc">Haase</font>,
  "will not agree to hand over the German officers to the British." We
  think it would be only fair if Germany would send us the name and address
  of this honest man.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Leather is being used in the new Spring suits, says a daily newspaper.
  Smith Minor informs us that he always derives greater protection from the
  use of a piece of stout tin.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The collecting of moleskins has been forbidden by the Belgian
  Government except in gardens. Lure the beast into the strawberry bed by
  imitating the bark of the wild slug and the rest is mere spade-work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that there is some talk of Lord <font
  class="sc">Fisher</font> giving up work and retiring into politics.</p>

<h2>A STORY WITH A POINT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With Mr. Punch's apologies for not having sent it on to
"The Spectator."</i>)</p>

  <p>Geoffrey has an Irish terrier that he swears by. I don't mean by this
  that he invokes it when he becomes portentous, but he is always annoying
  me with tales, usually untruthful, of the wonderful things this dog has
  done.</p>

  <p>Now I have a pointer, Leopold, who really is a marvellous animal, and
  I work off tales of his doings on Geoffrey when he is more than usually
  unbearable.</p>

  <p>Until a day or two ago we were about level.</p>

  <p>Although Geoffrey knows far more dog stories than I do, and has what
  must be a unique memory, I have a very fair power of invention, and by
  working this gift to its utmost capacity I have usually been able to keep
  pace with him.</p>

  <p>As I said, the score up to a few days ago was about even; yesterday,
  however, was a red-letter day and I scored an overwhelming victory. Bear
  with me while I tell you the whole story.</p>

  <p>I was struggling through the porridge of a late breakfast when
  Geoffrey strolled in. I gave him a cigarette and went on eating. He
  wandered round the room in a restless sort of way and I could see he was
  thinking out an ending for his latest lie. I was well away with the toast
  and marmalade when he started.</p>

  <p>"You know that dog of mine, Rupert? Well, yesterday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I let him talk; I could afford to be generous this morning. He had
  hashed up an old story of how this regrettable hound of his had saved the
  household from being burnt to death in their beds the night before.</p>

  <p>I did not listen very attentively, but I gathered it had smelt smoke,
  and, going into the dining-room, had found the place on fire and had
  promptly gone round to the police-station.</p>

  <p>When he had finished I got up and lit a pipe.</p>

  <p>"Not one of your best, Geoffrey, I'm afraid&mdash;not so good, for
  instance, as that one about the coastguard and the sea-gulls; still, I
  could see you were trying. Now I'll tell you about Leopold's
  extraordinary acuteness yesterday afternoon.</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;he and I&mdash;were out on the parade, taking a little
  gentle after-luncheon exercise, when I saw him suddenly stop and start to
  point at a man sitting on one of the benches a hundred yards in front of
  us; but not in his usual rigid fashion; he seemed to be puzzled and
  uncertain whether, after all, he wasn't making a mistake."</p>

  <p>Here Geoffrey was unable to contain himself, as I knew he would
  be.</p>

  <p>"Lord! That chestnut! You went and asked the man his name and he told
  you that it was Partridge."</p>

  <p>"No," I said, "you are wrong, Geoffrey; his name, on inquiry, proved
  to be Quail. But that was only half the problem solved. Why, I thought,
  should Leopold have been so puzzled? And then an idea struck me. I went
  back to the man on the bench and, with renewed apologies, asked him if he
  would mind telling me how he spelt his name. He put his hand into his
  pocket and produced a card. On it was engraved, '<font class="sc">J.M.
  Quayle</font>.' Then I understood. It was the spelling that puzzled
  Leopold."</p>

<hr />

<h3>THE NEW APPEAL.</h3>

  <p>We observe with interest the latest development in the London
  Press&mdash;the appearance of the new Labour journal, <i>The Daily
  Nail</i>.</p>

  <p>In the past, attempts to found a daily newspaper for the propagation
  of Labour views have not always met with success. Possibly the fault has
  been that they made their appeal too exclusively to the Labour public. We
  understand that every care will be taken that our contemporary shall
  under no circumstances be a financial failure.</p>

  <p><i>The Daily Nail</i> is a bright little sheet, giving well-selected
  news, popular "magazine" and "home" features, and, on the back page, a
  number of pictures. It has a strong financial section, a well-informed
  Society column, and a catholic and plentiful display of advertisements,
  including announcements of many of those costly luxuries which Labour
  to-day is able to afford.</p>

  <p>While in its editorial comments it suggests emphatically that the
  Government of the day is not and never can be satisfactory, it refrains
  from embarrassing our statesmen with too many concrete proposals for
  alternative methods.</p>

  <p>We learn that the new Labour daily is substantially backed by a
  nobleman of pronounced democratic ideals. From his Lordship down to the
  humblest employee there exists among the staff a beautiful spirit of
  fellowship unmarked by social distinction.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, comrade," is the daily greeting of his Lordship to the
  lift-boy, who replies with the same greeting, untarnished by
  servility.</p>

<h2>THE INSOMNIAC.</h2>

  <p>Miss Brown announced her intention of retiring to roost. Not that she
  was likely to sleep a blink, she said; but she thought all
  early-Victorian old ladies should act accordingly.</p>

  <p>She asked Aunt Angela what she took for her insomnia. Aunt Angela said
  she fed it exclusively on bromides. Edward said he gave his veronal and
  <font class="sc">Schopenhauer</font>, five grains of the former or a
  chapter of the latter.</p>

  <p>They prattled of the dietary and idiosyncrasies of their several
  insomnias as though they had been so many exacting pet animals. Miss
  Brown then asked me what I did for mine.</p>

  <p>Edward spluttered merrily. "He rises with the nightingale, comes
  bounding downstairs some time after tea and wants to know why breakfast
  isn't ready. Only last week I heard him exhorting Harriet to call him
  early next day as he was going to a dance."</p>

  <p>They all looked reproachfully at me because I didn't keep a pet
  insomnia too. I spoke up for myself. I admitted I hadn't got one, and
  what was more was proud of it. All healthy massive thinkers are heavy
  sleepers, I insisted. They must sleep heavily to recuperate the enormous
  amount of vitality expended by them in their waking hours. Sleep, I
  informed my audience, is Nature's reward to the blameless and energetic
  liver. If they could not sleep now they were but paying for past years of
  idleness and excess, and they had only themselves to blame. I was going
  on to tell them that an easy conscience is the best anodyne, etc., but
  they snatched up their candles and went to bed. I went thither myself
  shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>I was awakened in the dead of night by a rapping at my door.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" I growled.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;Jane Brown," said a hollow voice.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Hush, there are men in the house."</p>

  <p>"If they're burglars tell 'em the silver's in the sideboard."</p>

  <p>"It's the police."</p>

  <p>I sat up in bed. "The police!&mdash;why?&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"Shissh! come quickly and don't make a noise," breathed Miss
  Brown.</p>

  <p>I hurried into a shooting-jacket and slippers and joined the lady on
  the landing. She carried a candle and was adequately if somewhat
  grotesquely clad in a dressing-gown and an eider-down quilt secured about
  her waist by a knotted bath-towel. On her head she wore a large black
  hat. She put her finger to her lips and led the way downstairs. The hall
  was empty.</p>

  <p>"That's curious," said Miss Brown. "There were eighteen mounted
  policemen in here just now. I was talking to the Inspector&mdash;such a
  nice young man, an intimate friend of the late Sir <font
  class="sc">Christopher Wren</font>, who, he informs me privately, did
  <i>not</i> kill Cock Robin."</p>

  <p>She paused, winked and then suddenly dealt me three hearty
  smacks&mdash;one on the shoulder, one on the arm and one in the small of
  the back. I removed myself hastily out of range.</p>

  <p>"Tarantulas, or Peruvian ant-bears, crawling all over you," Miss Brown
  explained. "Fortunate I saw them in time, as their suck is fatal in
  ninety-nine cases out of a million, or so <font
  class="sc">Garibaldi</font> says in the <i>Origin of Species</i>." She
  sniffed. "Tell me, do you smell blood?"</p>

  <p>I told her that I did not.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>

  <p>"I do," she said, "quite close at hand too. Yum-yum, I like warm
  blood." She looked at me through half-closed eyelids. "I should think
  you'd bleed very prettily, very prettily."</p>

  <p>I removed myself still further out of range, assuring her that in
  spite of my complexion I was in reality anæmic.</p>

  <p>She pointed a finger at me. "I know where those policemen are. They're
  in the garden digging for the body."</p>

  <p>"What body?" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"Why, <font class="sc">Einstein's</font>, of course," said Miss Brown.
  "Edward murdered him last night for his theory. Didn't you suspect?"</p>

  <p>I confessed that I had not.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she said; "smothered him with a pen-wiper. I saw him do it,
  but I said nothing for Angela's sake, she's so refined."</p>

  <p>She darted from me into the drawing-room. I followed and found her
  standing before the fireplace waving the candle wildly in one hand, a
  poker in the other and sniffing loudly.</p>

  <p>"We must save Edward," she said; "we must find the body and hide it
  before they can bring in a writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>. It is here. I
  can smell blood. Look under the sofa."</p>

  <p>She made a flourish at me with her weapon and I at once dived under
  the sofa. I am a brave man, but I know better than to withstand people in
  Miss Brown's state of mind.</p>

  <p>"Is it there?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then search under the carpet&mdash;quickly!"</p>

  <p>She swung the poker round her head and I searched quickly under the
  carpet. During the next hour, at the dictates of her and her poker, I
  burrowed under a score of carpets, swarmed numerous book-cases, explored
  a host of cupboards, dived under a multitude of furniture and even
  climbed into the open chimney-place of the study, because Miss Brown's
  nose imagined it smelt roasting flesh up there. These people must be
  humoured. When I came down (accompanied by a heavy fall of soot) the lady
  had vanished. I rushed into the hall. She was mounting the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going now?" I demanded.</p>

  <p>She leaned over the balustrade and nodded to me, yawning broadly: "To
  Edward's room. He must have taken the corpse to bed with him."</p>

  <p>"Stop! Hold on! Come back," I implored, panic-stricken. Miss Brown
  held imperviously on. I sped after her, but mercifully she had got the
  rooms mixed in her decomposed brain and, instead of turning into
  Edward's, walked straight into her own and shut the door behind her. I
  wedged a chair against the handle to prevent any further excursions for
  the night and crept softly away.</p>

  <p>As I went I heard a soft chuckle from within, the senseless laughter,
  as I diagnosed it, of a raving maniac.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I got down to breakfast early next morning, determined to tell the
  whole sad story and have Miss Brown put under restraint without further
  ado.</p>

  <p>Before I could get a word out, however, the lunatic herself appeared,
  looking, I thought, absolutely full of beans. She and Aunt Angela
  exchanged salutations.</p>

  <p>"I hope you slept better last night, Jane."</p>

  <p>"Splendidly, thank you, Angela, except for an hour or so; but I got up
  and walked it off."</p>

  <p>"Walked it off! Where?"</p>

  <p>"All over the house. Most exciting."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you were walking about the house last night all by
  yourself?" Aunt Angela exclaimed in horror.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown shook her grey head. "Oh, no, not by myself. Our
  sympathetic young friend had a touch of insomnia himself for once and was
  good enough to keep me company." She smiled sweetly in my direction. "He
  was <i>most</i> entertaining. I've been chuckling ever since."</p>

<h2>MARDI GRAS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With the British Army in France.</i>)</p>

  <p>"Have you reflected, <i>mon chou</i>," said M'sieur Bonneton,
  complacently regarding the green carnations on his carpet-slippers, "that
  to-morrow is Mardi Gras?"</p>

  <p>"I have," replied Madame shortly.</p>

  <p>"One may expect then, <i>ma petite,</i> that there will be
  <i>crêpes</i> for dinner?"</p>

  <p>"With eggs at twelve francs the dozen?" said Madame decidedly. "One
  may not."</p>

  <p>On any other matter M'sieur would probably have taken his wife's
  decision as final, but he had a consuming passion for <i>crêpes</i>, and
  was moreover a diplomat.</p>

  <p>"<i>La vie chère!</i>" he said sadly; "it cuts at the very vitals of
  hospitality. With what pleasure I could have presented myself to our
  amiable neighbours, the Sergeant-Major Coghlan and his estimable wife,
  and said, 'It is the custom in France for all the world to eat
  <i>crêpes</i> on Mardi Gras. Accept these, then, made by Madame Bonneton
  herself, who in the making of this national delicacy is an incomparable
  artist.' But when eggs are twelve francs the dozen"&mdash;he shook his
  head gloomily&mdash;"generous sentiments must perish."</p>

  <p>Madame perceptibly softened.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, after all, I might persuade that miser Dobelle to sell me a
  few at ten francs the dozen," she murmured; and M'sieur knew that
  diplomacy had won another notable victory.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, at this precise moment the tenants of the <i>premier
  étage</i> of 10 <i>bis</i>, rue de la République, were also engaged in a
  gastronomic discussion.</p>

  <p>"If almanacs in France count as they do in Aldershot," said Mrs.
  Coghlan, "to-morrow will be Shrove Tuesday."</p>

  <p>"An' what av it?" demanded Sergeant-Major Coghlan of the British
  Army.</p>

  <p>"What of it? As though ye'd not been dreaming of pancakes this
  fortnight an' more past&mdash;fearful to mention thim an' fearful lest I
  should forget. Well, well, if ye'll bring a good flour ration in the
  marning I'll do me best."</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking, Peggy lass," said the gratified Sergeant-Major,
  "it wud be the polite thing to make a few for thim dacent people on the
  ground-flure. I'll wager they've niver seen th' taste av' a pancake in
  this country."</p>

  <p>Thus it was that when Hippolyte Larivière, the cornet-player of the
  Palais de Cinéma, ascended the stairs to his eerie on the top-floor of 10
  <i>bis</i> the following evening the appetising odour of frying batter
  enveloped him as a garment. He sniffed appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"<i>Le gros</i> Bonneton can eat <i>crêpes</i> freely without
  considering the effect on his temperament," he said. "One sometimes
  regrets the demands of Art."</p>

  <p>Outside the Coghlans' door another idea struck him. "The essence of a
  present lies not in its value but its appropriateness. A few
  <i>crêpes</i> on Mardi Gras would be a novel acknowledgment to the
  Sergeant-Major of his liberality in the way of cigarettes. At present my
  case is empty."</p>

  <p>Retracing his steps he went to the Café aux Gourmets and persuaded the
  <i>propriétaire</i> to prepare half-a-dozen <i>crêpes</i> with all
  possible speed and send them piping-hot to his room in exchange for a
  promise of his influence in getting her on the free list of the Cinema.
  Then, in a glow of virtue, he returned to prepare his toilette for the
  evening performance.</p>

  <p>It was while Hippolyte was dabbing his cheeks with a damp towel that
  M'sieur Bonneton and Sergeant-Major Coghlan, having comfortably satisfied
  their respective appetites with <i>crêpes</i> and pancakes, proceeded to
  call upon each other, bearing gifts. The dignity of the presentations was
  impaired by the fact that they almost collided on the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Coghlan wud like your opinion on these pancakes," said the
  Sergeant-Major, dexterously fielding one that was sliding from the
  plate.</p>

  <p>"And permit me to beg your acceptance of these <i>crêpes</i>, a dish
  peculiar to France and eaten as a matter of custom on Mardi Gras," said
  M'sieur in his most correct English, producing his plate with a flourish
  worthy of a head-waiter.</p>

  <p>"'Tis with all the pleasure in life we'll be tasting thim&mdash;"
  commenced Coghlan. Then his eye fell on the dish and his voice dropped.
  M'sieur was also showing signs of embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"It seems <i>crêpes</i> is but another name for pancakes," said the
  Sergeant-Major heavily, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"But yes&mdash;and I am already filled to repletion."</p>

  <p>"We've aiten our fill too, Peggy an' me, an' they're spoilt whin
  they're cowld. It's severely disappointed Peggy will be to find thim
  wasted."</p>

  <p>"And Madame will be desolated to despair."</p>

  <p>They stared blankly at each other for a few minutes. Then M'sieur took
  a heroic resolve.</p>

  <p>"We must not hurt the feelings of those excellent women," he said
  firmly. "There is but one course open to us."</p>

  <p>Coghlan nodded assent. Solemnly and without enthusiasm they sat on the
  stairs and consumed the pancakes to the last crumb. Then, leaden-eyed and
  breathing hard, they took their empty plates and entered their respective
  flats.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later they again encountered on the stairs. Once more
  they were laden with comestibles.</p>

  <p>"For Monsieur Larivière," explained M'sieur. "Madame insisted. She has
  a heart of gold, that woman."</p>

  <p>"Peggy's sending these up too," said the Sergeant-Major. "I towld her
  thim pancakes was the greatest surprise you iver tasted."</p>

  <p>M'sieur nodded. In response to Hippolyte's invitation they entered the
  room, and M'sieur took command of the conversation. The Sergeant-Major
  stood stiffly to attention, feeling that the occasion demanded it.</p>

  <p>"Two little gifts," said M'sieur, "of epicurean distinction. The
  <i>crêpes</i> of Madame Bonneton are an achievement, but the pancakes of
  Madame Coghlan are irresistible."</p>

  <p>"I thank you from the recesses of my heart," said Hippolyte with
  emotion; "but&mdash;you understand me&mdash;as the slave of Art I am
  compelled to forgo such pleasures."</p>

  <p>"My friend," said M'sieur sternly, to refuse them would be an affront
  to the cooking of these excellent ladies. A true housewife esteems her
  cooking only next to her virtue. You must <i>eat</i> them&mdash;while
  they are hot."</p>

  <p>"But my <i>tremolo</i>&mdash;my <i>sostenuto</i> will be ruined," said
  Hippolyte wildly.</p>

  <p>"What is your <i>tremolo</i> to a woman's tears?" said M'sieur, with
  an elegance born of a fear that he might be compelled to eat the pancakes
  himself. "The laws of hospitality&mdash;chivalry&mdash;<i>l'entente
  cordiale</i> itself&mdash;demand that you finish them."</p>

  <p>When Hippolyte finally yielded, his rapid and efficient despatch of
  the dainties excited the admiration of his hosts. They had collected
  their plates and were taking their departure, with expressions of regard,
  when a knock announced the arrival of a <i>garçon</i> from the Café aux
  Gourmets, bearing a dish of crisp hot <i>crêpes</i>.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Messieurs," said Hippolyte dramatically to his departing
  visitors. "It must not be said that Hippolyte Larivière lacks in
  neighbourly feeling. Behold my seasonable gift!"</p>

  <p>M'sieur groaned. The Sergeant-Major, being a soldier, concealed his
  apprehensions. Wild thoughts of surreptitiously disposing of them in a
  coal-bin whirled through their minds, but Hippolyte apparently divined
  their thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I regret that I must forgo the pleasure I promised myself of asking
  the ladies to take <i>crêpes</i> with me," he said. "To offer these would
  be a poor compliment to their superlative efforts. But there is no reason
  why <i>you</i> should not eat them here."</p>

  <p>"I have an excellent reason," said M'sieur, stroking his waistcoat.
  "And the gallant Sergeant-Major, I imagine, has another."</p>

  <p>"Bah! what is a little digestive inconvenience to a breach of
  courtesy?" cried Hippolyte maliciously. "You must eat them. <i>The law of
  hospitality demands it.</i>"</p>

  <p>When M'sieur and the Sergeant-Major stumbled unsteadily downstairs ten
  minutes later their eyes bulged with the expression of those whose cup of
  suffering is filled to overflowing.</p>

  <p>"But after all," as M'sieur remarked, placing his hand on his heart,
  whence it insensibly wandered to a point lower down, "it is some
  satisfaction to know that the feelings of our excellent wives remain
  unlacerated."</p>

<h3>SHATTERED ROMANCES.</h3>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;I read in a weekly paper
  that "plans are well in hand for putting up other Government Department
  buildings at Acton, which looks to have a future of its own, that of a
  sort of suburban Whitehall."</p>

  <p>Have you considered what this new departure means for those who, like
  myself, are the writers of political romance? To all intents we have lost
  the Ball-platz; we have lost the Wilhelmstrasse, and now here is
  Whitehall going out into the suburbs.... No doubt our leading Ministers,
  attracted by the more salubrious air, will establish themselves in the
  environs of the Metropolis, leaving behind them only the lower class of
  civil servant. Have you considered the devastating effect of this
  change?</p>

  <p>Think what we used to give our readers: "A heavy mist lay over
  Whitehall. High above the seething traffic the busy wires hummed with the
  fate of Empires." How, I ask you, will it look when they read: "The busy
  wires above Lewisham High Street hummed with the fate of Empires"?</p>

  <p>Or think of the thrill that was conveyed by this (it comes in three of
  my most recent books): "He looked, with a little catch in the throat, and
  read the number, 'Ten'&mdash;No. 10, Downing Street, where the finger of
  fate writes its decrees while a trembling continent waits, where empires
  are made and unmade&mdash;the hub of the universe...." Doesn't that make
  even <i>your</i> heart beat faster? But who will thrill at this: "He
  waited for a moment before the bijou semi-detached villa (bath h. and
  c.), known as Bella Vista, in Rule Britannia Road, Willesden Junction;
  then with a swift glance up and down he stealthily approached. When the
  neat maid opened the door, 'Is the Prime Minister in?' he asked?" (He did
  not hiss. Who could hiss in that atmosphere?)</p>

  <p>Or take this from my last book (shall I ever write its like again?):
  "Men, bent with the weight of secrets which, if known, would send a
  shiver through the Chancelleries of Europe, could be seen hurrying across
  the Mall in the pale light and going towards the great building in which
  England's foreign policy is shaped and formulated." But the Foreign
  Office at Swiss Cottage, or Wandsworth&mdash;I could not write of it. And
  there will be the India Office at Tooting, or Ponder's End, or
  at&mdash;But how can your "dusky Sphinx-like faces, wrapt in the mystery
  of the East, be seen passing the purlieus of"&mdash;the Ilford
  Cinema?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>You ask me, Tommy, to tell you the really bravest deed</p>

      <p>And, although the hero was never so much as an O.B.E.,</p>
      <p>I think I can safely pronounce it the bravest known to me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>It was not done in the trenches, nor yet in a submarine,</p>

      <p>It happened in Nineteen-Twenty, when he was in town on leave.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He was strolling along the pavement, a pavement packed to the kerb,</p>
      <p>When he felt a sudden craving for China's fragrant herb,</p>
      <p>So he turned into a tea-shop&mdash;as he said, "like a silly fool"&mdash;</p>
      <p>Which was patronised by the leaders of the ultra-Georgian school.</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He ordered his tea and muffin, and, as he munched and sipped,</p>
      <p>Strange scraps of conversation his errant fancy gripped,</p>
      <p>Strange talk of form  and  metre, of "Wheels" and of <font class="sc">Sherard Vines</font>,</p>
      <p>And scorn of <font class="sc">Tennyson</font>, <font class="sc">Browning</font> and <font class="sc">Swinburne</font> (of The Pines).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A hush fell on the tea-shop, and then the storm arose</p>
      <p>As a chunk of old dry seed-cake took him plumb upon the nose,</p>
      <p>And a cup, a generous jorum, of boiling cocoa nibs,</p>
      <p>Hurled by a brawny Georgian, struck squarely on his ribs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>For several hectic minutes the air was thick with buns,</p>

<h3>DOMESTIC STRATEGY.</h3>

  <p>I will admit that it was I who gave Mrs. Brackett the idea. But to
  blame me for the very unfortunate <i>dénouement</i> is ridiculous.</p>

  <p>I met Mrs. Blackett in Sloane Street.</p>

  <p>"I'm on my way to a registry-office," she said. "No, not that kind of
  registry-office; I'm not about to commit bigamy. I mean the kind where
  domestic assistants are sought, but mostly in vain. I suppose you don't
  know of a cook, a kitchenmaid, a housemaid, a parlourmaid and a
  tweeny?"</p>

  <p>I confessed that I did not. But I told her the story of some friends
  of mine who had been in a similar position and had succeeded in
  reorganising their establishment by an ingenious strategy.</p>

  <p>"The wife went away to stay with friends in the country," I said, "and
  the husband went to the registry-office, representing himself to be a
  bachelor, a rather easy-going bachelor. It seems that such establishments
  are popular with the few domestic servants still at large. After a short
  time he let it be known that he was really married, but separated from
  his wife; and after a further interval he called his household together
  and with tears in his voice informed them that he and his wife had
  composed their differences and that she was returning to him on the
  morrow. I understand that it was a complete success."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brackett was very much impressed by this story.</p>

  <p>"If I don't find anyone to-day I shall try it," she said as we
  parted.</p>

  <p>She did not find anyone, and, she did try it. She left home the
  following day, as I learnt from Brackett when I met him a week later.</p>

  <p>"Your tip's come off absolutely A 1," he said, "and I'm most awfully
  obliged. The worry was getting on my wife's nerves. As it is I filled up
  my establishment a couple of days ago and, as everything is going well,
  I've wired my wife to come home to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Have you broken it to the maids?" I asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; but I shall just tell 'em in the morning," said Brackett.
  "That'll be all right."</p>

  <p>I felt at the time that he was being far too precipitate, but he
  seemed so confident that I didn't interfere. The sequel was
  disastrous.</p>

  <p>In the first place Brackett, in his casual way, omitted to say
  anything about his being married until Mrs. Brackett was actually in the
  house. Even then he seems to have been rather ambiguous in his
  explanations. Anyway the new maids were, or affected to be, profoundly
  shocked. They intimated that they would never have entered so irregular
  an establishment had they known, and departed <i>en masse</i> after
  spreading a scandal among the tradespeople which will take the Bracketts
  twenty years to live down.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Tuesday, February 10th.</i>&mdash;As <font class="sc">His
  Majesty</font> read his gracious speech to the assembled Lords and
  Commons did his thoughts flow back for a moment to the last time he
  opened Parliament in person? It was on another February 10th, in 1914,
  and so little was the coming storm foreseen that the customary
  announcement, "My relations with Foreign Powers continue to be friendly,"
  was followed by a special reference to the satisfactory progress of "my
  negotiations with the German Government and the Ottoman Government"
  regarding&mdash;Mesopotamia, of all places.</p>

    <font class="sc">I am afraid I am getting controversial</font>."&mdash;
    <i>Mr. Lloyd George.</i>
  </div>
  <p>Since then everything has changed&mdash;save one. Ireland remains the
  skeleton at the feast. The condition of that unhappy country still causes
  <font class="sc">His Majesty</font> "grave concern," to be removed, let
  us piously hope, by the promised Home Rule Bill. It is true that, as Lord
  <font class="sc">Dufferin</font> said when moving the Address in the
  Lords, no one in Ireland appears to want the Bill; but then, as Colonel
  <font class="sc">Sidney Peel</font>, the Mover in the Commons, remarked
  with equal truth, the ordinary rules of thought do not apply to the Irish
  Question.</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> has lately been advised by
  a candid friend to take a six months' holiday "to recover his
  resilience." Mr. <font class="sc">Adamson</font> and Sir <font
  class="sc">Donald Maclean</font> found him nowise lacking in that quality
  when he came to reply to their criticisms of the King's Speech. The
  Labour leader, convinced by a fortnight in Ireland that the present
  Administration was all wrong, and that the Government's Bill would do
  nothing to improve it, was bluntly asked, "Are we to withdraw the troops
  and leave the assassins in charge?" while the "Wee Free" champion, who
  had interpreted the recent by-elections as a sign that the time for the
  Coalition was past, was unkindly reminded that, at any rate, the results
  of these contests had furnished no encouragement to the party that he
  adorns. "But I am afraid I am getting controversial," said Mr. <font
  class="sc">Llloyd George</font>, to the amusement of the House, which had
  enjoyed his sword-play for half-an-hour; and with that he turned to the
  task of defending the new policy in Russia. Having failed to subdue the
  Bolshevists by force, we are now going to try the effect of
  commerce&mdash;a modern reading of "Trade Follows the Flag." The Labour
  Party cheered the new departure vociferously, but the rest of the House
  seemed a little chilly, and Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font>, at the
  <font class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> elbow, looked about as happy as
  <font class="sc">Napoleon</font> on the return from Moscow.</p>

    <p>HILARITY OF MR. CHURCHILL ON HEARING HIS CHIEF'S VIEWS ABOUT
    RUSSIA.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Lord <font class="sc">Hugh Cecil</font> raised the standard of
  economy, and complained that the legislative programme was extravagantly
  long. "A large number of Bills generally meant a large amount of
  expenditure." I have myself observed this phenomenon.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, February 11th.</i>&mdash;The Lords, having disposed of
  the Address with their usual celerity, welcomed Baron <font
  class="sc">Riddell</font> of Walton Heath (and, perhaps I may add,
  Bouverie Street) to their ranks, and then adjourned for a week.</p>

  <p>If all Labour Members possessed the sweet reasonableness of Mr. <font
  class="sc">Brace</font> we should view the advent of a Labour Government
  without any of Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill's</font> misgivings. The
  Member for Abertillery argued the case for the nationalisation of mines
  so gently and genially that before he sat down I am sure that a good half
  of his hearers began to think that, after all, there was "something in
  it." Visions of a carboniferous millennium, when there would be no more
  strikes and hardly any accidents, and altruistic colliers would hew their
  hardest to get cheap and abundant coal for the community, floated before
  the mind's eye as Mr. <font class="sc">Brace</font> purred persuasively
  along.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/126-3.png"><img width="100%" src="images/126-3.png"

    THE PIED PIPER OF ABERTILLERY

    <p class="center">(<font class="sc">Mr. W. Brace</font>).</p>

    <p>"<font class="sc">For he led us, he said, to a joyous
    land</font></p>

    <p><font class="sc">Where waters gushed and fruit-trees
    grew,</font></p>

    <p><font class="sc">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,</font></p>

    <p><font class="sc">And everything was strange and new.</font>"</p>
  </div>
  <p>Unfortunately for the Nationalisers Mr. <font class="sc">Lunn</font>
  thought it necessary later to make a blood-and-thunder oration,
  threatening all sorts of dreadful things (including a boycott of the
  newspapers) if the Miners' demands were refused. Moreover, he made it
  clear that coal was only a beginning and that the Labour Party's ultimate
  objective was nationalisation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
  id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> all round, and wound up by reminding the
  House that "we are many and ye are few."</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> is not the man either to
  miss a chance or refuse a challenge. The tone of his reply was set by Mr.
  <font class="sc">Lunn</font>, not by Mr. <font class="sc">Brace</font>;
  and though he had plenty of solid arguments to advance against the motion
  the most telling passage in his speech was a quotation from "Comrade
  <font class="sc">Trotsky</font>," showing what Nationalisation had spelt
  in Soviet Russia&mdash;labour conscription in its most drastic shape. The
  nation, he declared, that had fought for liberty throughout the world
  would stand to the death against this new bondage.</p>

  <p>Result: Amendment defeated by 329 to 64.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, February 12th.</i>&mdash;This was the first Question-day
  of the new Session, and the House was flattered to see Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> in his place, despite the counter-claims
  of the Peace Conference at St. James's Palace. Evidently he means this
  year to "stick to the shop" more closely, in view, perhaps, of the
  possible return from Paisley of the old proprietor.</p>

  <p>To a Labour Member's complaint that several ex-Generals had been
  appointed as divisional Food officers, Mr. <font
  class="sc">McCurdy</font> replied that no preference was given to
  military candidates. But why not? Where will you find more competent
  judges of alimentary questions than in the higher ranks of His Majesty's
  Forces?</p>

  <p>In attacking the provisions of the Peace Treaty with Germany as
  "impracticable," Sir <font class="sc">Donald Maclean</font> revealed
  himself as a diligent student of a recent notorious book. Most of his
  observations&mdash;excepting, perhaps, the statement that he had "no
  sentimental tenderness for the Germans"&mdash;were marked with the brand
  of <font class="sc">Keynes</font>, and his assertion that the utmost
  Germany could pay was two thousand millions came bodily from that eminent
  statistician. To the same inspiration was possibly due the unhappy
  suggestion that our chief Ally was pursuing a policy of revenge.</p>

  <p>For this he was promptly pulled up by Lord <font class="sc">Robert
  Cecil</font>, who warned him not to judge the policy of France by the
  utterances of certain French newspapers. Lord <font
  class="sc">Robert</font> had, however, his own quarrel with the
  Government, who, according to his account, had done nothing to set
  Central Europe on its legs again, except to send it a certain amount of
  food&mdash;not, one would would have thought, an altogether bad
  preliminary.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Mr. <font class="sc">Balfour</font> had not a
  stronger indictment to answer, for he was dialectically at his best.
  After complimenting the Opposition leader on his "charming tones and
  anodyne temper" he proceeded to take up his challenge&mdash;"if I may
  call it a challenge." If Germany was in doubt as to the amount she might
  be called upon to pay, she had her remedy, for the Peace Treaty
  especially provided that she might offer a "lump sum." The list of
  war-criminals was long, no doubt, but we had limited our own demands to
  those who were guilty of gratuitous brutality. As for the condition of
  Central Europe, that was not the fault of the Peace Treaty, it was the
  fault of the War, and this country had done all it reasonably could to
  remedy it.</p>

  <p>The Opposition insisted on taking a division, and were beaten by 254
  to 60. So far the "doomed Coalition" seems to be doing rather well.</p>

<h2>THE AMALGAMATED SOCIETY
OF PASSENGERS.</h2>

  <p>"I've hit on something at last," cried Charles exultantly, throwing
  himself down on my second-best armchair.</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't hit on it so hard," I complained; "the springs
  are half-broken already. What's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard," he inquired, "of the black-coated
  salariat?"</p>

  <p>"The egg of the greater green-backed woodpecker&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't a bird," he said; "it's a class of people that works with
  its brains. And the hand of Labour, according to my evening paper, is
  being held out to it."</p>

  <p>"But suppose one wears a pepper-and-salt suit," I said, "and writes
  'Society Gossip.' What about that?"</p>

  <p>"That's just my point. All these accepted lines of distinction are
  absolutely wrong. It isn't what people work at that divides them, it's
  the way they travel to their work. Sir <font class="sc">Thomas
  Malory</font> knew that. When <i>Lancelot</i> was going to rescue
  <i>Guinevere</i> he had his white horse badly punctured by a bushment of
  archers and had to finish the journey in a woodcutter's cart. And that
  was a great disgrace to him and made the <i>Queen's</i> ladies laugh. It
  would be just the same with the typists of a rich employer if his
  motor-car broke down and he had to arrive in a bus. How do you get to
  town in the morning yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I am a Tuber," I said sadly. "Every bright morning I say I will go by
  bus, but when I reach the Tube station the draught sucks me in through
  the door, the man grabs me by the collar, throws me into the sink, lifts
  up the plug and down we go into the drain-pipe together. I think I have
  the brand of Tubal Cain on my brow. It is a kind of perpetual
  crease&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I too Tube," said Charles; "but I know many eminently respectable bus
  people as well. Especially bus-women. They ride about, they tell me, on
  the most fantastically labelled vehicles and are always seeing new
  suburbs swim into their ken, and gazing&mdash;</p>

      <p>'Out over London with a wild surmise,</p>
      <p>Silent upon a seat of No. 10,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>or whatever the bally thing may be. But I never join their rash
  adventures. I belong to a different <i>milieu</i>. I move in a sort of
  social underworld. Not that I can deny, of course, that there is a
  certain amount of overlapping."</p>

  <p>"I overlapped twice to-day myself," I said, "and as the second one was
  knitting a jumper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then there are the Tram-ites," he went on. "I don't understand
  their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg
  135]</span> world either. The tram, I am told, suddenly plunges with a
  loud roar like a walrus under the streets of Holborn and emerges on the
  Embankment. The hansom cabs were called the gondolas of London. The
  trams, I suppose, are the submarines. But they are not of my life. I do
  not mingle with them."</p>

  <p>"I mingled with a tram once," I said. "I clasped it warmly by the rail
  as it was going by, but I missed the step with my foot. It spurned me
  rather badly. But kindly explain what you're driving at."</p>

  <p>"All these classes," said Charles, "have their own friendships, their
  own jolts and jars, their own way of being bullied by conductors and
  thrown into the mud and squeezed into cages and arranged upon straps. But
  they have one great thing in common, distinct though they may be. They
  are all passengers, all takers of tickets. There is going to be a Bus
  Union, a Tube Union, and a Tram Union, and when necessary they will
  combine."</p>

  <p>"Against what?"</p>

  <p>"Against the motorists, first and foremost," said Charles. "The
  opulent people who ride a-wallop to their offices in cars. Suppose that
  Ethelinda Bellairs, who is a trifle absent-minded, has got the sack for
  typing a letter like this: 'I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
  communication of the 25th ult., and ask you to note that a sudden sense
  of indefinable yearning seized Hephzibah. She closed her eyes and slowly
  swayed towards him. Awaiting the favour of an early reply,
  etc.'&mdash;what happens? There is an immediate strike of the Bus Union
  until she is reinstated. If necessary the two other branches of the
  Amalgamated Society of Passengers are called out. No case of hardship
  will be too insignificant for the A.S.P. We shall all carry a symbol in
  the shape of a secret season ticket. When the strike occurs nobody will
  go to work in the morning. All the stations and starting-places will be
  picketed; business will be paralysed."</p>

  <p>"Except for the stout fellows who walk," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"They will find it very lonely at their offices," said Charles.
  "Nobody wants to work if there's any excuse to avoid it, and the beauty
  of the thing is that we can strike not only against ordinary employers,
  but against the raising of fares, and against the N.U.R. or the Vehicle
  and Transport Workers Union itself. That will be the quickest strike that
  has ever been struck. You can't go on banging lifts and gates and rushing
  about in empty buses without anybody to shove into the dirt or any thumbs
  to snip bits out of. It takes all the enjoyment out of life."</p>

  <p>"And where exactly do you come in?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I intend to be the Organising Secretary of the A.S.P.," he said. "It
  will be hard work, but very meritorious."</p>

  <p>"Rather a nuisance won't it be on strike days," I inquired, "going
  round and visiting a few thousand pickets on foot in your black coat,
  with the brain waves working on top?"</p>

  <p>"The O.S. of the A.S.P.," answered Charles magnificently, "will not
  move about on foot. He will be provided with a handsome motor-car."</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">Carnival.</font>"</p>

  <p>Those who imagined that they were to be given a dramatic version of
  Mr. <font class="sc">Compton Mackenzie's</font> romance must have been
  shocked to find that the entertainment provided at the New Theatre was
  just a variation, from an Italian source, of the general idea of
  <i>Pagliacci</i>. But it was the only palpable shock they sustained, for
  never did a play run a more obvious course from start to finish. When you
  have for your leading character an actor-manager, who plays the part of
  <i>Othello</i>, with his wife as <i>Desdemona</i> (how well we know to
  our cost this conjugal form of nepotism), and discusses in private life
  the character of the Moor&mdash;whether a man would be likely to indulge
  his jealousy on grounds so inadequate&mdash;speaking with the detached
  air of one who is absolutely confident of his own wife's fidelity, you
  don't need much intelligence to foresee what the envy of the gods is
  preparing for him. The remainder is only a matter of detail&mdash;what
  particular excuse, for instance, the lady will find for a diversion, and
  to what lengths she will go.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/129.png"><img width="100%" src="images/129.png"

    <p><i>Simonetta</i> (<i>Miss <font class="sc">Hilda Bayley</font></i>).
    "<font class="sc">Are you pleased with my fancy dress? It was to be a
    great surprise.</font>"</p>

    <p><i>Count Andrea</i> (<i>Mr. <font
    class="sc">Neilson-Terry</font></i>). "<font class="sc">Nothing
    surprises me in this play.</font>"</p>
  </div>
  <p>In the present case her only excuse was the old one, that she was
  "treated like a child." Certainly she deserved to be, for her behaviour
  was of the most wilful and wayward; but she was the mother of a strapping
  boy, and a woman who is thought old enough to play, in the premier
  Italian company, the part of <i>Desdemona</i> (with the accent, too, on
  the second syllable) could hardly justify her complaint that she was
  regarded as a juvenile.</p>

  <p>The choice of the Alfieri Theatre for the scene of the culmination of
  the domestic drama seemed to touch the extreme of improbability. The
  actors were not a poor travelling company of mummers, as in
  <i>Pagliacci</i>, with no decent private accommodation for this kind of
  thing. The protagonist of <i>Carnival</i> was lodged in a perfectly good
  Venetian palace, where there was every convenience for having the matter
  out with his wife and her lover. For the rest the plot was commonplace to
  the verge of banality.</p>

  <p>As <i>Silvio Steno</i>, in his home life, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Matheson Lang</font> was excellently natural, but as
  <i>Othello</i> his make-up spoilt his nice face and tended to alienate
  me. As <i>Simonetta</i> (I got very sick of the name) Miss <font
  class="sc">Hilda Bayley</font> had a difficult part, and failed, from no
  great fault of her own, to attach our sympathies, till in the end she
  explained her rather inscrutable conduct in a defence which gave us for
  the first time a sense of sincerity in her character. There was too much
  play with her Carnival dress of a Bacchante, which, perhaps, was less
  intriguing than we were given to understand. Mr. <font class="sc">Dennis
  Neilson-Terry</font> has a certain distinction, but he did not make a
  very perfect military paramour. His intonation seemed to lack control,
  and he has a curious habit of baring his upper teeth when he is getting
  ready to make a forcible remark.</p>

  <p>As for the scenes, they were alleged to be Venice (where the Doges
  wedded the sea), but there was no visible sign of water. You called for a
  gondola, which always sounds better than a taxi, but it never appeared.
  Perhaps, however, for one has not always been very happy in one's
  experiences of stage navigation, this was just as well.</p>

<p class="author">O.S.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">Peter Ibbetson.</font>"</p>

  <p>That incorrigible romanticist, <font class="sc">George du
  Maurier</font> of happy memory, was so transparently sincere as to be
  disarming. No use telling him "life's not like that." "That's just it,"
  he'd say, and get on with his pleasant illusions. <i>Peter Ibbetson</i>
  is certainly not tuned to the moods of this decade, but it would be a
  pity if we all became too sophisticated to enjoy such occasional
  excursions into the land of almost-grown-up make-believe.</p>

  <p>If life doesn't give you what you want, then "cross your legs, put
  your hands behind your head," go to sleep and live a dream-life of your
  own devising&mdash;that is the theme. The bare essentials of the story
  are that the beloved <i>Mimsy</i> of <i>Peter's</i> happy childhood
  becomes the wife of a distinctly unfaithful duke; while <i>Peter</i>
  finds himself in prison for killing his quite gratuitously wicked uncle,
  and for forty years reprieved convict and deceived duchess meet in dreams
  till her death divides and his again unites them.</p>

  <p>It is a considerable tribute to both author and adapter (the late
  <font class="sc">John Raphael</font>) that their work should, at the
  height of the barking season, hold an audience silent and apparently
  enthralled, in spite of the handicap that, in order to make the story in
  any degree intelligible, much time had to be given to more or less
  tedious explanations.</p>

  <p>I will not pretend that the motives of the characters were clear or
  that (for me) the phantasy quite passed the test of being translated from
  the medium of the written word into that of canvas, gauze and costumed
  players, with those scufflings of dim figures in the semi-darkness and
  that furtive and by no means noiseless zeal of scene-shifters; or, again,
  that I was much attracted by a picture of the life after death, in which
  opera-going (please <i>cf.</i> Mr. <font class="sc">Vale Owen</font>)
  figured so prominently. Indeed I think that the play would be better if
  it ended with the death of the dreamers and did not attempt that
  hazardous last passage.</p>

  <p>But certainly there were quite admirable tableaux and some very
  intelligent individual playing&mdash;in contrast with the team-work of
  (particularly) the First Act, which was ragged and amateurish.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Basil Rathbone's</font> <i>Peter</i> was an
  effective study, avoiding Scylla of the commonplace and Charybdis of the
  mawkish&mdash;no mean feat. A young man with a future, I dare hazard;
  with a gift of clear utterance, and sensibility and a useful figure.</p>

  <p>It is a good deal to say that Miss <font class="sc">Constance
  Collier</font> so contrived her <i>Duchess of Towers</i> as to make us
  understand <i>Peter's</i> worship.</p>

  <p>Miss <font class="sc">Jessie Bateman's</font> <i>Mrs. Deane</i> seemed
  to me an exceedingly competent piece of work, and Mr. <font
  class="sc">Gilbert Hare</font> thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful of
  <i>Colonel Ibbetson's</i> wickedness, and made us share his appreciation.
  And you couldn't accuse him of over-playing, though he certainly looked
  too bad to be true.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">William Burchill's</font> little sketch of an old
  French officer was almost too poignant.</p>

  <p>Why the landlord of the <i>Tête Noir</i> was got up to resemble Mr.

<h2>THE ORDER OF THE B.S.O.</h2>

  <p>One of the oldest of Mr. Punch's young men thought he would like to
  hear some orchestral music on Monday week last, so he dropped in at the
  Queen's Hall to assist at a concert of the new British Symphony
  Orchestra. The name of the founder and conductor, Mr. <font
  class="sc">Raymond Roze</font>, was already familiar, for Mr. Punch's
  young man was old enough to remember Mr. <font class="sc">Roze's</font>
  mother, <font class="sc">Marie Roze</font>, in her brilliant prime as
  <i>prima donna</i> of the Carl Rosa Company; and he is glad to know that
  she is still living in her beloved Paris, where she was decorated by
  <font class="sc">M. Thiers</font> for her gallant conduct during the
  siege of 1870. So it is pleasant to find her son so actively associated
  in the good work of finding permanent musical engagements for demobilised
  soldiers in the British Symphony Orchestra.</p>

  <p>The B.S.O. men are not home-keeping soldiers. Every one of them has
  served over-seas, and it was a pity that their names and the record of
  their services were not printed in the programme, for it is a fine and
  inspiriting list, and a striking disproof of the old tradition that
  musicians must needs be long-haired, sallow and unathletic. Alert and
  young and vigorous they appealed to the eye as well as to the ear, and
  they played, as they fought, gloriously, these minstrel boys who had all
  gone to the War. Strings and woodwind, brass and percussion, all are up
  to the best professional level.</p>

  <p>There is no movement which has a stronger claim on all men and women
  of goodwill than that for providing employment for demobilized soldiers,
  and the British Symphony Orchestra is a first-rate contribution to that
  desirable end. The <i>personnel</i> of the orchestra is all that can be
  desired. It was bad luck that Mr. <font class="sc">Raymond Roze</font>
  was prevented by illness from conducting last week, but the band was
  fortunate in securing an admirable substitute in Mr. <font
  class="sc">Frank Bridge</font>. Mr. Punch gives the scheme his blessing
  without reserve, but with a word of advice. To win for the B.S.O. the
  success it deserves will need good judgment as well as energy and
  efficiency. The art of programme-framing has to be studied with especial
  care in view of the powerful but, we believe, perfectly friendly
  competition of other established organizations. Last week's programme had
  its <i>beaux moments</i>, but it had also at least two <i>mauvais quarts
  d'heure</i>. The men, however, were splendid.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">John Hastings Turner</font>, who had already to
  his credit a play, a novel and various successful revues, has now
  produced, in <i>A Place in the World</i> (<font
  class="sc">Cassell</font>), what is, I understand, to some extent a
  fictional version of his play. How far this may be so I am uncertain (not
  having seen the play), but I am by no means uncertain that it makes here
  a wholly admirable story, one moreover that shows a notable advance in
  Mr. <font class="sc">Turner's</font> art as novelist, being firmer in
  touch and generally more matured than anything he has yet written. The
  plot concerns the adventures, spiritual and other, of <i>Madame Iris
  Iranovna</i>, pampered cosmopolitan beauty, when fate or her own
  egotistical whim had dumped her as a temporary dweller in the
  semi-detached villas of suburbia. The theme, you observe, is one that
  might excuse the wildest farce, since the effect of <i>Iris</i> upon her
  unfamiliar surroundings was naturally devastating. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Turner</font> however has chosen the more ambitious path of
  high comedy. In <i>Iris</i> herself, and even more in the kindly old
  vicar who so unexpectedly confronts her with her own weapons of wit and
  worldly wisdom, he has drawn two characters of genuine and moving
  humanity. I shall not tell you how the conflict (essential to real
  comedy) works itself out, nor after what fashion the empty brilliance of
  <i>Iris</i> is humiliated and transformed. If I have a criticism of Mr.
  <font class="sc">Turner's</font> method, it is that, as with
  <i>Bunthorne</i>, a "tendency to soliloquy" is growing upon him which
  will need watching. But he clothes his reflections pleasantly enough.
  Already known as what the old lady called "an agreeable rattlesnake," he
  has now proved himself a story-teller of conspicuous promise.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><font class="sc">Von Falkenhayn's</font> <i>General Headquarters
  1914-1916 and its Critical Decisions</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hutchinson</font>) seems an honester book than <font
  class="sc">Ludendorff's</font>; less political, less querulous, less
  egoistic. <font class="sc">Von Falkenhayn</font>, who was War Minister
  when the War began and retained his office after he had superseded <font
  class="sc">Von Moltke</font> as Chief of the General Staff, shows himself
  incurably Prussian, refusing even to consider the possibility that any
  State which could wage war effectively would hesitate to do so from any
  ethical or humanitarian scruple. "Don't bother about a just cause, but
  see that it appears just before men," he seems to say. "The surprise
  effect of gas (at Ypres) was very great," is all the comment that tragic
  episode draws from him. He was a submarine campaign whole-hogger. But he
  has his own soldierly virtues of modesty and loyalty, and refuses to air
  his personal grievances in the matter of his supersession by the <font
  class="sc">Hindenburg-Ludendorff</font> syndicate. If, as seems likely,
  he speaks the truth, as he had opportunity to see it, we must revise our
  too flattering estimates of the German superiority in numbers and
  attribute a good deal of the stubbornness of their defence to their
  quicker appreciation of the character of siege war. The holding of
  front-line trenches with few men and consequent immense saving of life
  was, according to the General, practised by the German Command long
  before we discovered its value. He gives a reasoned criticism, which has
  to the layman a plausible air, to the effect that <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> the
  relative failure of Joffre's great combined Champagne-Flanders offensive
  of 1915 was due to the overcrowding of the attacking armies. General
  <font class="sc">von Falkenhayn</font>, though he has a prejudice for the
  German soldier, can bring himself to testify to the valour of his British
  and French opponent. A readable and conscientious account of a difficult
  stewardship.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I wish I could feel as enthusiastic about <i>The Booming of Bunkie</i>
  (<font class="sc">Jenkins</font>) as <i>Mr. Peter McMunn</i>, who,
  falling off a motor-cycle, landed in that quiet Scots village and
  proceeded to turn it, by a series of stunts, into a well-known
  watering-place. He undertook the job, I gather, partly for a joke and
  partly for the bright eyes of <i>Evelyn Kirbet</i>, whose father put up
  the money for the purposes of publicity and propaganda. The
  transformation of a hamlet into a seaside resort has been treated as a
  sort of psychological romance by Mr. <font class="sc">Oliver
  Onions</font> in <i>Mushroom Town</i>, where the human beings are a
  background as it were for the bricks and mortar; Mr. <font
  class="sc">A.S. Neill</font>, having chosen to make a farce of it, has
  provided a hero who believes in humorous advertisements, and has
  evidently persuaded the author to take him at his own valuation. This is
  hardly to be wondered at, since <i>Mr. McMunn</i> seems always keener on
  popping his puns than on selling his goods. Specimens are given of
  speeches, press articles, posters and cinema productions, but the fun
  rages with the most furious intensity round the golf links, where
  eighteen holes have been compressed into the usual space of one and the
  winner stands to lose drinks. There are also some parodies of <font
  class="sc">Robert Burns</font>, some jokes about bathing-machines and
  some digs at the Kirk. One has been, of course, before to seaside places
  that were a bit too bracing, and I am afraid that the air of Bunkie
  leaves me cold.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I really think that <i>The World of Wonderful Reality</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>) may come to be something of a
  test for your true follower of Mr. <font class="sc">E. Temple
  Thurston</font>. You recall the ingredients that went towards the first,
  or <i>Beautiful Nonsense</i>, book? Sentiment in the slums, Venice with a
  very big V and poverty <i>passim</i> might be regarded as its
  composition. Well, here you have <i>John</i> and <i>Jill</i> home again;
  no more Venice, a palpably decreasing sentiment and only poverty to fill
  up with. I am bound to confess that I found <i>John's</i> protracted
  preparation for his nuptials rather less than enough as subject-matter
  for a whole book. Of course all this time there remained <i>Amber</i>
  (you recollect her; she "also ran" for the <i>John</i> stakes), and at
  the back of your mind a comfortable conviction that two strings are still
  better than one. Having censured the book for insufficient plot, I had
  better not proceed to give away what there is. I will content myself with
  a personal doubt as to whether <i>John</i> and <i>Jill</i> will quite
  reduplicate their former triumph&mdash;and that for various reasons, not
  least because (for purposes of sequel, I suppose) even <i>Jill</i>
  herself has been permitted so grave a lapse from the attitude of
  stand-anything-so-long-as-it's-slummy-enough that so endeared her to her
  former public. Touch that and the bloom is indeed gone.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>With the Chinks</i> (<font class="sc">Lane</font>), a volume of the
  "Active Service Series," treats of the training of Chinese coolies for
  work with the Labour Corps in the B.E.F. The special interest of the
  racial type was, for me, exhausted by the charming photographs; the task
  remaining for Mr. <font class="sc">Daryl Klein</font>, Lieutenant in the
  Chinese Labour Corps, of so conveying the atmosphere as to absorb the
  reader's attention, was not achieved. On the two main aspects of the
  topic, the origin in China and the result in France, he makes no serious
  attempt. I got no clear impression of the coolie at home or of why he
  took to being an ally, and I was left with but the vaguest conception of
  the unit in France, since the narrative ended at the disembarcation.
  Lastly, I have with regret to complain of one sentence in particular,
  where he tells us: "It is high time I said something about the officers."
  He had, from the general reader's point of view, already said too much.
  It is a pity to have to speak thus moderately of a war-book obviously
  written with care and treating of an enterprise which must have cost much
  labour in the achieving and, in the achievement, must have duly
  contributed to our victory. For those personally involved it will be a
  welcome memento. For the conscientious historian it will have a certain
  unique value. And in fairness it must be added that in the latter half
  there are touches of humour and humanity which make the reading easy and
  pleasant.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It has been my lot, and I am far from complaining about it, to read
  many war-books, but never has my luck been more completely in than when
  <i>With the Persian Expedition</i> (<font class="sc">Arnold</font>) fell
  into my hands. Major <font class="sc">Donohoe</font>, while never losing
  sight of his main object, finds time to tell us a number of entertaining
  stories with a sedate humour which is most attractive. Seldom has an
  expedition set out on a wilder errand than this of the "Hush-hush"
  Brigade, or, as it was officially known, the "Dunsterville" or "Bagdad
  Party." It was commanded by General <font class="sc">Dunsterville</font>,
  and briefly its objects were to combat Bolshevism, train Persian levies,
  prevent the Huns and Turks from threatening India by way of the Caspian
  Sea, and a few other little things of the same nature. The men of this
  "party" were picked men, and it is enough to say that their courage was
  as high as their numbers were few. It is indeed a mystery why any of them
  escaped with their lives, for, as experience proved, it was one thing to
  train Persian levies and another to get them to fight when they were
  wanted to. And without the levies the "Hush-Hush" party was outnumbered
  again and again. I could have wished that the excellent map which is
  firmly embedded in the binding had been detachable, for the interest of
  the chronicle compelled me constantly to refer to it, and I suffered
  great distraction.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
